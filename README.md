# Engineering & Algorithmic Solutions 🚀

This repository contains a collection of technical challenges and data structure problems solved with a **Senior Software Engineering** approach.

The goal is not only to find the optimal solution, but also to apply robust design principles, readability, and efficiency, simulating the standards of high-level companies.

## 🛠️ Technologies and Tools
* **Programming language:** Python 3.9+
* **IDE:** PyCharm / VS Code
* **Testing:** Assertions and local unit testing.

## 🧠 Resolution Methodology
1. **Relevance Analysis:** Why this problem is important in real-world settings (e.g., fraud detection, payment processing).
2. **Knowledge Checklist:** Necessary data structures and paradigms.
3. **Trade-offs and Design:** Evaluation of temporal complexity $O(N)$ vs. spatial complexity $O(M)$.
4. **Edge Cases:** Handling null inputs, duplicates, and data limits.
